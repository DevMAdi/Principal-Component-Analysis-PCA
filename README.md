There are two types of Dimensionality Reduction techniques:

 - **Feature Selection**
 - **Feature Extraction**

**Feature Selection** techniques: **Backward Elimination**, **Forward Selection**, **Bidirectional Elimination**, **Score Comparison** and more.

### Feature Extraction techniques:

 - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
 - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
 - **Kernel PCA**
 - **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
---------------------------------------

From m-independ. var. of dataset.
**PCA** extracts P<= m new independent var. that explains most of variance of dataset
"regardless of dependent var."

Thus PCA is **unsupervised** model as dependent var. not considered.
